                    <p>The consensus after evaluating the Ecorustics website was that it lacked alot of the common navigation and interactions that modern sites of the same category have.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Landing page lacked information architecture and main call to action.</li>
                        <li>Users had to enter the menu to find all available accomodations.</li>
                        <li>Menu options had unclear labeling.</li>

                <p>When the high fidelity frames were presented to our Product Owner they were immediatly stamped as finalized and ready for development. Altough great that the frames were beyond expectations and visualy pleasing, user testing was unfortunatly down prioritized and we were tasked to continue with visual design and user flow for the rest of the site.</p>

                        The project was set to last 8 weeks with priority to re-design the frontpage of Ecorustics, we accomplished that withing the first 4 weeks. I would say that even though we never got to conduct user tests the project over all was a great success and our product owner was very satisfied with the result. We did add animation to most of the features in our prototype just in case UX-tests would be done in the future.</p>
